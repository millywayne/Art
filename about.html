    <h3>African Hair</h3>
    <p>
      Natural African hair ranges from wavy to kinky-coily, with a wide range of variation between the two. (And yes,
      some
      Black people have naturally straight hair as well.) In fact, texture differences exist not only in families,
      including siblings, but even
      on the same head of hair. In general, Black hair types tend to be:
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Drier to the touch than other hair textures</li>
          <li>Extremely difficult to over-condition </li>
          <li>Fragile Natural hair can look strong, but this is a very delicate texture and needs to be handled as such.
            This means frequent conditioning and moisturizing and as little direct heat as possible to maintain optimum
            health.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>African Dance</h3>
      <p>African societies, dance serves a complex diversity of social purposes. Within an indigenous dance tradition,
        each performance usually has a principal as well as a number of subsidiary purposes, which may express or
        reflect
        the communal values
        and social relationships of the people. In order to distinguish between the variety of dance styles, therefore,
        it
        is necessary to establish the purpose for which each dance is performed. Dancing is carried out during:

        <li>Religious festivals </li>
        <li> Masquerade Dancing </li>
        <li>Social gatheirng </li>
        <li>Work dances </li>
        <li>Dance for recreation</li>

        <h3 class="label">People of Africa</h3>

        <p>Africa is the most tropical of all the continents; some four-fifths of its territory rests between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. As a consequence, the cultures and the physical variations of the peoples reflect adaptation to both hot, dry
            climates and hot, wet climates. Dark skin is the dominant characteristic of indigenous African peoples, but skin colour is not uniform. </p>
        <p>Skin colour shows a clinal variation from a light or tan colour in the northern fringe of the continent, which has a Mediterranean climate, to very dark skin in certain Sudanic regions in western and East Africa, where radiation from the Sun has
            been most intense. Africa has the most physically varied populations in the world, from the tallest peoples to the shortest; body form and facial and other morphological features also vary widely. It is the continent with the greatest human
            genetic variation, reflecting its evolutionary role as the source of all human DNA.</p>

        <h3 class="label">Africa's art and architecture(Egypt)</h3>

        <p>
            The ancient architectural monuments, sculptures, paintings, and applied crafts produced mainly during the dynastic periods of the first three millennia BCE in the Nile valley regions of Egypt and Nubia. The course of art in Egypt paralleled to a large
            extent the country’s political history, but it depended as well on the entrenched belief in the permanence of the natural, divinely ordained order.</p>
        <p>Artistic achievement in both architecture and representational art aimed at the preservation of forms and conventions that were held to reflect the perfection of the world at the primordial moment of creation and to embody the correct relationship
            between humankind, the king, and the pantheon of the gods. For this reason, Egyptian art appears outwardly resistant to development and the exercise of individual artistic judgment, but Egyptian artisans of every historical period found different
            solutions for the conceptual challenges posed to them.</p>

        <h3 class="label">African literature </h3>
        <p> Traditional written literature, which is limited to a smaller geographic area than is oral literature, is most characteristic of those sub-Saharan cultures that have participated in the cultures of the Mediterranean</p>
        <p> The relationship between oral and written traditions and in particular between oral and modern written literatures is one of great complexity and not a matter of simple evolution. Modern African literatures were born in the educational systems
            imposed by colonialism, with models drawn from Europe rather than existing African traditions. But the African oral traditions exerted their own influence on these literatures.</p>
